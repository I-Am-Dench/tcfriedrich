                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>This is an emulator core of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">MOS 6502 Processor</a> implemented as microcode state machine.
                Initially, I wanted to use the original microcodes from the actual 6502, and in doing so, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://c74project.com/">C74-6502 Project</a> 
                (A modern recreation of the processor) which detailed their own microcodes. This unintentionally turned this project into an emulator for the C74-6502, but I am still 
                happy with the outcome nontheless.</p>
                <p>The emulator works well, but it is missing Decimal Mode and proper unit tests for certain scenarios (i.e. branching on page boundaries).</p>

                        <p>This is a sample test program which calculates the nth term in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci Sequence</a>. This specific program considers the first 0 in the sequence as term 0, thus term 10 would be 55. The result of the program is pulled directly from the CPU's accumulator.</p>
