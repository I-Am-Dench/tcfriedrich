                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Theo's Crib is a passion project of mine which took about a year to build, and is continuously maintained.</p>
                <p>This is a website I developed to keep connected with friends and to keep some amount of continuity between video games we play.
                Users can create and post to threads, link their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> accounts to show off their achievements, and link video game accounts to their
                Theo's Crib accounts for Theo's Crib specific servers.</p>
                <p>For example, users can connect their Minecraft account to their Theo's Crib account and then receive special Theo's Crib achievements by playing on the server.</p>
                <p>The website can be found at <a href="https://www.theoscrib.net">https://www.theoscrib.net</a>, however, this website is <b>invite only</b>. In order to register an account you must be given a registration key.</p>
                
                <h3>Profile</h3>
                <figure class="window-screenshot">
                    <img src="/public/images/projects/theoscrib_profile.png" alt="An image of my profile page of the live Theo's Crib website. Next to my profile image is the text AntiTheos with the text Theo Friedrich under it."/>
                    <figcaption>This is an example profile on the Theo's Crib website. This my profile containing a <u>Bio</u> section, an <u>Info</u> section, a <u>Recent Post</u> section, and a <u>Steam</u> section.
                    At the bottom of the profile, which is not pictured, there is a <u>Games</u> section which display's the user's currently linked games.</figcaption>

                <h3>Steam</h3>

                <p>One of my favorite features that I added, was the ability to show off your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com">Steam</a> achievements on your profile.
                While it is not necessarily a very complex feature, it was one of the first dynamic features I added to the site and my first time dealing with third-party authentication, so it holds a special place for me.
                Not to mention that I am also happy with how everything looks stylistically.</p>

                    <figcaption>This is a screenshot taken from the <u>Settings</u> page which showcases my Steam settings. Once an account is linked,
                    the user is able to select which games they want to display on their profile. Games that do not contain any achievements cannot be selected.</figcaption>
